This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 
project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Technical Choice
As the react team recommends using Next.js for creating a new react app (https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) and not using create-react-app anymore,
For that have created this project using Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project based on the `.env.example` file, and fill in the necessary environment variables.

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
 

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
